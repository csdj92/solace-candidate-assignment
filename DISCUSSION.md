# Proposed Improvements
   Ran into a few issues while working on this assignment. Couldnt get docker desktop and wsl to work together windows kept throwing errors when trying to install wsl2 which ate of some of my time here are some of the improvements I would have made.

## Performance Improvements

### Frontend
- **Virtualized rendering** for large datasets in AdvocatesTable
- **Debounce search input** to reduce API calls 
- **Lazy loading** for advocate profile images
- **Client-side caching** of search results using localStorage or IndexedDB

### Backend
- **Redis caching** for frequent search queries
- **Database indexing** on searchable fields (name, location, specialty)
- **Search query optimization** using full-text search (PostgreSQL tsvector)
- **Pagination implementation** instead of full dataset returns

## UI/UX Enhancements
- **Advanced filtering** (location radius, experience range, languages)
- **Loading skeletons** for table rows
- **Empty states** with illustration and guidance
- **Keyboard navigation** support for table for better user experience/accessibility
- **Responsive design** improvements for mobile
- **Accessibility** audit and ARIA labels

## Data Handling & Integrity
- **Input validation** for search parameters
- **Rate limiting** on API endpoints
- **Data sanitization** for search queries
- **Error boundaries** in React components
- **Proper typing** for API responses (currently missing in some endpoints)


## Immediate Action Items
1. Implement debounced search with proper abort controller
2. Add pagination to API endpoints
3. Create loading states for search interface
4. Add database indexes for common search fields
5. Set up proper error handling throughout data flow
